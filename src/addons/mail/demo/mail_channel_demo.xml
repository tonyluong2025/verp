<p>
    Dear Board Members,
</p>
<p>
    The main events of the month of October are:
</p>
<p>
    <b>Sales:</b>
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Invoicing is respectively of 442k€ for our European company (66% of the budget) and $404k for the U.S. office (75% of the budget). Despite these numbers that are far below our initial expectations, the growth of the month of October is 51% compared to last year.</li>
    <li>The month of September having been better than our initial forecasts, the consolidated yearly revenue is only of $20k below our forecast made during the board of September.</li>
    <li>The consolidated forecast for the end of the year is $6.749k, which is a growth of 76% compared to last year and an achievement of 87% of the budget.</li>
    <li>The recruitment of new resellers has been very good, especially in Europe, where we signed 30 new resellers this month.</li>
</ul>
<p>
    <b>Finance :</b>
</p>
<ul>
    <li>The profit and loss has been negatively impacted this month by revenues that are far beyond the budget and charges that are 15% above the budget. The main extra we had in our charges this month is due to the provisioning of the salaries for the holidays period, $50k.</li>
    <li>We also got the payment of our long awaited subsidies, the cash level has increased of 300K€ which gives a current balance of 963 K€ without including the straight loan of 350 K€.</li>
    <li>The aged customer balance has been similar to the one of the last month with a small decrease of the DSO. We have recruited a new accountant assistant for the credit collection. She is mostly doing phone calls for all invoices that are due since 30 days, so we should get improvements of the DSO in November. The sum of the invoicing on which we have a risk in the aged customer balance is 100K€.</li>
</ul>
<p>
    <b>Resellers and Customers:</b>
</p>
<ul>
    <li>The total number of resellers is 429, across 87 countries.</li>
    <li>The total number of installations of our software increased to 37K, against 33K for the month of September but we still did not reached the highest level we reached during this year (44K in march and may)</li>
    <li>We have passed the 10000th customer in production with 10271 customers at the end of October. The paying customer ratio is 6,6%.</li>
</ul>
<p>
    <b>Launch of the new release:</b>
</p>
<p>
    We are working actively on the new release which is scheduled for the end of November.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>We will publish the release note this week</li>
    <li>The whole Sales Team will be trained on the new version this Friday</li>
    <li>We will do a public announce to our resellers the 21th of November. We plan to show them: a description of the new features, the new distribution strategy, the new pricing and the communication plan.</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<p>
    Nicolas, can you book a meeting room for our meeting of Friday 2pm?
</p>
<p>
    Regards.
</p>
