                Dear %%(partnerName)s,

                Despite several reminders, your account is still not settled.

                Unless full payment is made in next 8 days, then legal action
                for the recovery of the debt will be taken without further
                notice.

                I trust that this action will prove unnecessary and details of
                due payments is printed below.

                In case of any queries concerning this matter, do not hesitate
                to contact our accounting department.

                Best Regards,
