    We are disappointed to see that despite sending a reminder, that your account is now seriously overdue.
It is essential that immediate payment is made, otherwise we will have to consider placing a stop on your account
which means that we will no longer be able to supply your company with (goods/services).
Please, take appropriate measures in order to carry out this payment in the next 8 days.
If there is a problem with paying invoice that we are not aware of, do not hesitate to contact our accounting
department. so that we can resolve the matter quickly.
Details of due payments is printed below.

    Despite several reminders, your account is still not settled.
Unless full payment is made in next 8 days, legal action for the recovery of the debt will be taken without
further notice.
I trust that this action will prove unnecessary and details of due payments is printed below.
